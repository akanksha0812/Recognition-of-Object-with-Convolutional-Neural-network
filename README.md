# Recognition-of-Object-with-Convolutional-Neural-network
Object recognition is used to identify objects within digital images or video. It starts by detecting an object in different images, for example, a car, person, or building. Then, using machine learning algorithms, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), it identifies that specific object. The algorithms process the image, extracting features like edges, colors, and shapes. They then compare these features with known object characteristics in a database. Over time, through learning, the algorithms can predict the presence and identity of objects in new images, allowing for automated, accurate object recognition.
