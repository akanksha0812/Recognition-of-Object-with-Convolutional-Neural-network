# Recognition-of-Object-with-Convolutional-Neural-network
Object recognition is used to identify objects within digital images or video. It starts by detecting an object in different images, for example, a car, person, or building. Then, using machine learning algorithms, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), it identifies that specific object. The algorithms process the image, extracting features like edges, colors, and shapes. They then compare these features with known object characteristics in a database. Over time, through learning, the algorithms can predict the presence and identity of objects in new images, allowing for automated, accurate object recognition.

<h2>What Is Convolutional Neural Network</h2>
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at object recognition tasks by processing input images with convolutional and pooling layers. The convolutional layers apply filters to extract features, such as edges, textures, and shapes, from small parts of the image. Pooling layers reduce dimensionality and computational complexity while preserving the most important features. This process is repeated through multiple layers, each extracting more complex features. The final layers, typically fully connected, use these high-level features to classify the image, e.g., identifying the presence of specific objects. This hierarchical feature learning makes CNNs powerful for object recognition tasks.
